ExpressJS Challenge
Create an ExpressJS server that can perform the following actions:

Display a nice welcome message on its root route (eg. "localhost:3000/")

Repeat a POST'd message on a "repeater" route (eg. "localhost:3000/repeater"). The repeat functionality could be as simple as adding a received string to another string multiple times, and then returning that other string as the response.

Create a message controller that has routes representing CRUD. The CRUD routes don't have to actually do any database-interacting things, but the routes should return a different message so that you can see that your different web request HTTP verbs are triggering the right route.

Some of this stuff is explicitly shown during the lesson content - make sure you've gone through the content!

Since there are so many different ways that this could be implemented, there are no specific tests for this challenge. The solution is provided as an example of one way that you could address the requirements here - but give the challenge an attempt yourself before digging through the solution
