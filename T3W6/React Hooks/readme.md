Class To Hooks Conversion
Class to Hooks Conversion
Convert the provided code to use only function components and hooks, removing all classes from the code.

Note:

You'll have to create a React app locally, using create-react-app.

You'll need to install these packages:

react-router-dom

Create or edit files matching the files provided in the scaffold and copy the code into the matching files.

Then, edit the code that is now on your local computer.

The files provided in the scaffold are the only differences to what is otherwise a perfectly normal create-react-app project. Start with that template!

You should aim to replace the following:

replace all class components with function components

use hooks where appropriate

this includes using hooks for state, context, reducers

this includes replacing class lifecycle methods with appropriate usages of useEffect

this includes replacing props with appropriate usages of your choice of useState, useContext or useReducer hooks

this includes using useParams to replace not-D.R.Y usages of props

App functionality shouldn't change after you've completed the challenge.

Its appearance is entirely up to you, as it is NOT the point of this challenge.

You can compare your solution to the code provided in the Solution tab of the challenge, though we strongly recommend that you at least attempt the challenge yourself before looking at the solution!
